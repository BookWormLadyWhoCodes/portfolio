      <p>"Hello, my name is Jessica Janusz. 
        I am a tattooed, 34 year old stay at home mom from Boston, MA. 
        Now that my kids are in school full time, I am eager to learn from and collaborate with others as I break into the tech industry. 
        I have always loved interior design and had my own business doing professional organizing. I aim to merge my passion for design and knack for organization with software development and UX design."</p>
